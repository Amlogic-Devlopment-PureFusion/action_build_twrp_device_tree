# **TWRP Device Tree generation tool**

*   How to use this tool?
*   1\. First you have to get any of your devices that can boot the system
*   boot.img AB partition
*   recovery.img All partitions except AB partition

---

*   2\. Fork this warehouse under your username

*   3\. Upload recovery.img or boot.img to a location that can provide direct link download. Here I recommend uploading the img file directly to this warehouse, and then click in and click view raw to get the direct link

---

*   4\. Click actions-make twrp device-run workflow, and then enter the direct link you just obtained in that link box

---

*   5\. After filling in, click'Run workflow' to start running
